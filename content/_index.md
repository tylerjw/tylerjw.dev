  <div class="home-content">

I'm Tyler Weaver.
I work at [SciTec](https://scitec.com/), developing the next generation of strategic defense software.
Building robust software with others is what makes me excited each day.

In 1999, I started programming with the book "C in 21 Days".
Having written C++ for as long as I can remember, I've fallen in love with the Rust programming language.

While I now write Rust as my primary language, I still remember C++ and am contributing to making interoperable packaging a reality.
The [Common Package Specification](https://cps-org.github.io/cps/index.html) aims to create a mechanism for interop between build systems for creating and consuming packages.
