# üëãüèª Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm Tyler Weaver.
I work at [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai/) where I focus mainly on open source software for robotic arms.
Building robust software with others is my jam.
In 1999, I started programming with the book "C in 21 Days".
Having written C++ for as long as I can remember, I've fallen in love with the Rust programming language.

We need cross-platform, polyglot, per-project packaging and deployment solutions for working in federated open source software.
I believe [pixi](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/overview) is the best hope we have.
